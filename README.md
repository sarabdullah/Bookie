between pages and log in/sign up ,or
adding books to the favorites and
libraries ,and editing user information
we created it in a creative way and
joyfull colors for better user
experience .
we used mouse event and action

also we used Hibernate to connent with MySql We needed to create 2 tables, One for user
information and another one for books that the
user adds to the library or his favorite.
First table have 4 columns ( Username - Email -
Password - Birthdate ) which Username is the
primary key
